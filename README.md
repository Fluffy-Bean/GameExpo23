# GameExpo23
All new and improved DV8 Game Expo project
While the Expo page got scrapped due to multiple reasons, this repo still includes the following:

 - TheFrontRooms Server
 - Postgres Database for the Server
 - Caddy Proxy for hosting

If, like me, you want to run the Postgres server online for whatever reason, I suggest giving your database a very stong password, change the default user and database names and use the following guide for `fail2ban` support
